                            Based in London, UK, Ronnie White (Born: Veronica Delogu, 27/12/1987) brings the energy and an eclectic approach to the capital’s music scene. Originally from Sardinia, an island off the coast of Italy, she grew up in a ‘small town with a small village mentality’. Since her early years, she manifested a natural inclination towards music and singing, which led to her family buying her a karaoke machine at the age of 3. Having spent her early childhood as the ‘classroom underdog’, she wrote her first set of lyrics at the age of 12, as a mean to ‘free myself from all I wanted to say and all I wanted to forget I felt’. She grew up with her grandmother and her two uncles, one of which used to listen to 80’s Heavy Metal and Hard Rock music on a daily basis. During an interview she said: “My uncle used to record me on our old boombox, singing Iron Maiden tunes when I was about 2 years old. He still keeps some of the cassettes he recorded. Growing up, I remember my neighbors greeting me on my way back to school saying they always knew I was coming back by my voice, singing down the road. I must have been a true nightmare!” She learnt how to play guitar at the age of 8, when her aunt taught her the basics. She began composing the first tunes soon after.<br>
                            In her teens she pursued her passion for music and performing arts, by joining her high school’s Drama Club, where she performed at international school competitions around Europe. <br>
                            She also joined local drama clubs and worked/volunteered, amongst the others, with people with learning disabilities and young people from vulnerable social and family backgrounds. She also collaborated with established artists from her local music scene and toured in various venues, bringing poetry, literature and music together in a culturally oriented project.<br>
                            Ronnie, however, always wanted to leave her home town, after constantly feeling as a “misfit” and knowing there was so much more she wanted to experience and learn and a whole world to discover, outside of her enclosed social circle.<br>
                            Soon after she achieved her high school Diploma, she moved to Perugia, a town located in the heart of Italy, where she attended an International BSc in Biotechnology. During this time she had the opportunity to work with international research institutions, such as the Weill Cornell Medical College (NYC, USA), Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden), Nara Institute of Science and Technology (Nara, Japan), where she worked for over a year as Research Assistant on Cardiac Regeneration. <br>
                            During these years she was introduced to the digital world of music production and began drafting what will late become the base material for tracks such as her Debut Single “Temple” (2016) and her second release: “Demons” (April 2017). She stated that her music was morphed and developed mostly thank to the energy and the inspiration she collected during her travels.<br>
                            In 2011 she moved to London to pursue her artistic path and was also successfully offered to attend a MSc in Forensic Science at King’s College London.<br>
                            During this time she attended various modules in Drama, Musical Theatre and Screen Acting at City Academy. She also worked on experimental and ground breaking short movies, such as “Unreal Doll” (2012, Director: Jimmy Nsubunga), which was presented at independent film festivals, nation-wise.<br>
                            Establishing herself as an eclectic and cross-cutting artist and producer, Ronnie has also worked on joint projects with alternative pop-rock artist Reflections of an Atheist Believer on the single “London” (2016) and various live showcases around the capital. She also briefly worked together with electronic producer Indigo on a live project called Tiebreaks, in 2014.<br>
                            Ronnie is also a DJ and played numerous sets in various clubs in London between 2013 and 2016, to then focus solely on her artistic career.<br>
                            Her Debut Album, “Pandora’s Box” sees her ongoing collaboration with Minneapolis Producers Owen Sartori and Davide Raso, from F5 Soundhouse and is due to be completed by the end of 2017/ beginning of 2018
                            Her Debut Single “Temple” came out in September 2016 and is available on all major digital music platforms.<br>
                            Her second single, “Demons” is coming out on April 21, 2017.
